# gallery

A sample Flutter application that demonstrates the usage of the Floss library.
The application displays a gallery of interactive example that can be
manipulated using various pointer events. It includes examples of basic shapes,
transformations, and animations. The examples are adapted from
[nannou](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/nature_of_code) which
implements the examples from the book [Nature of
Code](https://natureofcode.com/).
