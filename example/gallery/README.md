# gallery

This is an example application for `floss`. It demonstrates basic usage of the
library by implementing examples from the book "Nature of Code". Many of the
examples are interactive and check for user input to modify the simulations.

## Usage
To run the examples, you need to have `floss` installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Then, you can run the example using the following command from the
`example/gallery` directory:

```bash
flutter run -d <device>
```
